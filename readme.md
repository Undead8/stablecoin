# Stablecoin and GIC POC
This is a POC of a stablecoin and a GIC smart contract. Some features and tests are not completed.

If you want to develop something like this, you should not use this code. You should use [OpenZeppelin library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity) and customize it for you needs.

## Not maintained
I do not maintain this and it uses older versions of truffle and solidity. You've been warned!
